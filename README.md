# NSE Scrapper Tools

This repository has scrapping tools for obtaining stock market stocks and their prices.
The first tool was a PDF scrapper which takes a PDF and extracts text from the pdf. 
A web scrapper is underway.


### Issues
Initial development of the PDF scrapper was halted because the PDFs are scanned and 
extracting text from image is complex. A simple OCR to scan the PDF was also not useful. 
This problem will be tackled later.
